## Course concept

- The course is freshly developed based on needs from people who deal with spatial data
- It is a new course, there is a certain flexibility to adjust the content!
- A team of R experts who use Geo-scripting languages every day helped to develop this course
- Feedback is welcome! You can use the following [anonymous form](http://goo.gl/forms/3iFSNgg3Ne to submit ideas, requests, bugs) 
- Avoid copy paste, and make sure you understand all steps

We will show you how to find help
  - Try to solve the problem as independent as possible
  - Work together with fellow students but make sure you complete everything yourself

## Course planning

[Planning of the geo-scripting course](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yTomAgB9Mny-h0ZEd0mhr0nU5_fD5ysZBAvFYqI5Fn4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Team work & helping eachother

- Teams of two (e.g. somebody who followed the `python` course and who didn't follow it)
- The [Q&A forum](http://www.geo-informatie.nl/courses/grs50406/question2answer/index.php) for everybody!
    - Try to obtain the highest score (overall score, best question, best answer)
    - Ask at least one good question
    - Answer at least one question

## Geo-scripting learning objectives

- Understand basic concepts of applied scripting for spatial data
- Use functions from a library while writing your script
- Find libraries which offer spatial data handling functions
- Know how to find help (on spatial data handling functions)
- Solve scripting problems (debug, reproducible example, writing functions)
- Read, write, and visualise spatial data (vector/raster) using a script
- Apply learned concepts in a case study with geo-data by solving a spatial/ecological/applied question 

## Why geo-scripting?

- Reproducible: avoid clicking and you keep track of what you have done
-	Efficient: you can write a script to do something for you e.g. multiple times e.g. automatically downloading data
-	Build your own tools and functions (e.g. raster filters, MODIS download tool, BFAST package)
-	Enable collaboration: sharing scripts, functions, and packages
-	Good for finding errors i.e. debugging

*examples of advantages of geo-scripting to be added here*
e.g. This course is fully written with scripting languages (i.e. R and MarkDown). What are the advantages?

## What  is a scripting language?

- A scripting language (e.g. R and Python) can interpret and automate the execution of tasks which could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator
- A scripting language is the glue, between different commands, functions, and objectives without the need to compile it for each OS/CPU Architecture
- Different from like C/C++/Fortran since these are languages that need to be compiled first.

## Compiling
- Compiling? Programmers write programs in a form called source code. Source code must go through several steps before it becomes an executable program. The first step is to pass the source code through a compiler, which translates the high-level language instructions into object code.

## The main scripting languages for GIS and Remote sensing currently are: 

- R
- Python
- GRASS (grass function are included in QGIS)
- Javascript for geoweb scripting
- Matlab
- IDL (ENVI)
- JavaScript
- ...

## Python versus R

- Python is a general purpose programming language with a clear syntax
- R is particularly strong in statistical computing and graphics
- Installing libraries in Python is sometimes challenging
- Syntactic differences can be confusing (especially when combining these) 
- There are many R and Python packages for spatial analyses and for dealing with spatial data
- Scripts in both languages can be combined:
  - call R from Python using e.g. RPy, RPy2
  - call Python from R (http://rpython.r-forge.r-project.org/)

## Many programs have support for

- Python (Blender, Sketchup, QGIS, MySQL, PostGIS)
- R (GRASS, QGIS, MySQL, PostGIS)
